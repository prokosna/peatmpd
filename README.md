# peatmpd

**peatmpd** is a [mpd](https://musicpd.org/) client powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/index.html), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

**Note: This is still WIP.**

This client is focusing on a smart playlist (multiple conditions search) and ability to flexibly edit playlists.

Currently following features are supported:
- Basic Player and Queue
- Tag Browser (inspired by gmpc)
- Playlists
- Smart Playlists

Because peatmpd is developed by using Electron, it is expected to work on various platforms such as Linux, Mac and Windows. **But nothing is tested except for Linux now.**
